# Living-Books-The-Tale-of-Tom-Kitten-by-Beatrix-Potter
A living book is a online book that is read loud.  You can click through the pages and listen to someone read it.  You can click around the background and see if something interesting happens.  You can click on the words in the story to see how they are pronounced.  It is a great activity for kids to do alone or with parents.
